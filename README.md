# guardian-for-kindle

This repository contains a forked version of [Mark Longair's `guardian-for-kindle`](https://github.com/mhl/guardian-for-kindle). I forked it mainly to make it work with Python 3 and possibly [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (I'm not quite sure about the latter part yet; I'm new to Lambda and looking into its capabilities at the moment). I'm also trying to familiarize myself with [The Guardian Open Platform](http://open-platform.theguardian.com) and [Kindle Format](https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000729511) for my future projects.

If you just want to read the Guardian on your Kindle, you can download the automatically generated output from [Mark Longair's website](http://mythic-beasts.com/~mark/random/guardian-for-kindle/), or even better, [purchase the official Kindle version from Amazon.](https://www.amazon.com/The-Guardian-and-the-Observer/dp/B004MME3M8)
