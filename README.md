# guardian-for-kindle

This repository contains a forked version of [Mark Longair's `guardian-for-kindle`](https://link.iamblogger.net/ud0pe). I forked it mainly to make it work with Python 3. I'm also using this project to familiarize myself with [The Guardian Open Platform](https://link.iamblogger.net/4adjv) and [Kindle Format](https://link.iamblogger.net/p1jwu) for my future projects.

If you just want to read the Guardian on your Kindle, I suggest you to download the automatically generated output from [Mark Longair's website](https://link.iamblogger.net/lamg6), or even better, [purchase the official Kindle version from Amazon.](https://link.iamblogger.net/8gj2w)

**Please note that `guardian-for-kindle` currently does NOT work on Windows.**
